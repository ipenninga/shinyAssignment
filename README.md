===============

This repository contains the ui.R and server.R files that were used to build a simple Shiny App deployed at Rstudio's shinyApps.io. The data used comes from a standard dataset in R: MASS, and concerns European Stock Indices from 1991 through 1998.
The app illustrates a radio check box mechanism and renders a plot of the selected data.
